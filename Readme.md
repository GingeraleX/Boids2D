# Boid Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Boid simulation implemented in Unity. Boids are entities that exhibit collective behavior, such as flocking, separation, alignment, and cohesion.

## Features

- Flocking behavior with separation, alignment, and cohesion
- Adjustable parameters for boid behavior
- Unity project setup for easy exploration and customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity (I'm using 2022.3.11f1)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/boid-simulation.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Unity.

3. Explore and customize the simulation as needed.

## Usage

- Open the `BoidScene` in Assets/Scenes to view and run the simulation.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the project to suit your needs. Some areas you might want to explore:

- Tweaking boid behavior parameters in the `BoidConfiguration`.
- Adding additional features or behaviors to enhance the simulation (point toward mouse?).
- Experimenting with different Unity assets or shaders for visual effects.

## Contributing

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
